						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						Saurabh Singh a graduating senior getting a B.S. in computer science and minor in Psychology. I came into GWU not knowing what I wanted to do with a computer science degree. But now slowly I've started to realize what I want to do. I had a interest in Psychology as well as computer science so I hope I can go into an area where they two meet.
