						<strong>Peer perspective:</strong> 
						With the internet spreading across the world, the more people have access to education. However even if education has spread more without proper guidance often times it can be difficult. Resources across the web such as Khan Academy, and ALEKS often only provide a yes or no type of question where they ask for the answer. Students when learning math will at somepoint make mistakes caused by misconceptions they have. These mistakes have not changed in years and are quite common. Peer Perspective goal is to have students be capable of identifying areas where misconceptions take place. In order to do this students are given: A topic list where they are asked to select a preferential topic. Randomly generated problems accompanied by their incorrect solutions. Step by step procedure generated by Wolfram Alpha. An incremental difficulty with progression.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						Saurabh Singh a graduating senior getting a B.S. in computer science and minor in Psychology. After graduating I will probably be traveling for a month or two before starting joining the work industry. Since I have an interest in both areas, I hope I can go into an area where they two meet.
